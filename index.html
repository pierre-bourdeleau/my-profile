                  Hello, I'm Pierre Bourdeleau, I'm sociable and I really like going out with my friends. I really enjoyed learning to code my own profile thanks to the wagon videos. I really like doing sports and especially skiing and climbing which I practice regularly. I also like to study languages and I would like to be able to speak many different languages.

        <p>
        I really like doing sports, especially skiing. Indeed, every winter I go skiing, I have reached the level of the silver arrow. Right now I'm watching the Alpine Skiing World Cup.

        <h2> Climbing </h2>
        <p>
        One of my favorite hobbies is rock climbing. I've been doing it since I was in college. When I return to Lyon, I do climbing afternoons with all my friends. I have to see if I can go rock climbing in Lille.

        <h2> My goals </h2>
        <p>
        I like to travel a lot, one of my goals would be to speak fluent English, Spanish and Arabic and why not learn new languages in the future. Moreover, at the professional level, I would like to create my own company and be self-employed.
